Hello there, I'm Katie!

I am an AI Research Resident at <a href="https://www.uber.com/ca/en/atg/" target="_blank">Uber ATG</a> working under professor Raquel Urtasun. My current research focuses on developing deep learning models for self driving technology. 

In the past I worked with the <a href="http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Robotic AI and Learning lab</a> in UC Berkeley, where I had the fortune to be adviced by professor Sergey Levine in deep reinforcement learning. 
I received my Bachelors and Masters of Science degrees at <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a>, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.

Hello there, I'm Katie!

Engineer, Dreamer, Nerd.

A first year electrical engineer and computer scientist born and raised in the Silicon Valley. I know six languages; of those, four are used to communicate with computers. A pop-music enthusiast and avid chicken lover (I have two as pets!), I believe that web design should also be an expression of myself.

I appreciate art, but my passion lies in science, technology, and mathematics. I particularly love the elegance of math and physics; formulas and equations developed by people long passed are very universal.

I currently study in University of California, Berkeley, exposed to the cutting edge technology constantly introduced. At the forefront of technology, computer science has amazing potential, and I love the opportunities that it promises.
